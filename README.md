# Arduino_Timer_Interrupt_Generator
Simple little script for generating timer interrupt code from a given ISR frequency.

Me, in my infinate quest to be as lazy as possible, got tired of looking up registers and calculating prescale values every time I wanted to write a timer-driven ISR, so I made this handy Python script to do everything for me. Enter in the desired interrupt frequency, generate code that you can copy and paste into the arduino IDE. It ain't pretty, but it works.

I'm going back to sleep.
